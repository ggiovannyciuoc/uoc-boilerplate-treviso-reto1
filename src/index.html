          Relatively untouched by the throngs of tourists from nearby Venice, 
          Treviso is an unspoiled, traditional Italian city. With fresco-painted 
          medieval buildings, deep blue waterways, and countless local artisans, 
          Treviso is a place to slow down and really absorb the culture. 
          And with Venice and the incredible Dolomites both within striking distance, 
          this could be the perfect home base for exploring Northern Italy. 
          Did we mention that Treviso is also the home of prosecco, tiramisu, and Benetton? 
          Letâ€™s visit Treviso!
